            <p class="lead">I know what you may be thinking: Why are we being tortured with an article about yet another
                Rolex timepiece that can’t easily be purchased? True enough, even though these Rolex GMT-Master II steel
                watches are technically available on the market, actually being able to buy a steel Rolex watch is an
                unenviable task for many consumers these days, given the high demand. That said, enough people are
                actually able to purchase these watches, and they will each be produced for long enough that most people
                who actually want one should be able to get one (eventually). So, let’s take a hands-on look at the 2021
                Rolex GMT-Master II references 126710BLNR (black and blue bezel) and the 126710BLRO (blue and red bezel)
                watches on the now-available three-link Oyster bracelets.</p>

            <p class="lead">The sun isn’t supposed to shine like this on the Northern California coast. Well, not this
                time of year, anyway — and most certainly not around this hour in the evening. But here we are —
                skimming alongside the Marin Headlands in a crimson Robinson R44 with nary a patch of fog to be seen,
                the late-summer sun bathing the cabin in a warm glow. The pilot banks hard at historic Point Bonita and
                points the four-seater northwest, leaving the weathered mid-century lighthouse to fade into the San
                Francisco skyline, a white speck behind the tail rotor.</p>

            <p class="lead">Ferrari North America recently celebrated 60 years of the iconic Italian car maker’s
                presence in the United States market. The main celebration was in Beverly Hills, California with a
                weekend of events including a tour of Ferrari cars on Rodeo Drive, a few parties, and a car auction. As
                the official watch making partner of Ferrari, Hublot was there attending the events and, of course, with
                a new limited edition watch, the Hublot Big Bang Ferrari USA 60th Anniversary reference
                401.QX.0123.VR.FSX14 timepiece.</p>
