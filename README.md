# **FlyWatch**

![Mock up FlyWatch]()

## **Goal for this project** 

Welcome to FlyWatch.

Come to our website to find the most exclusives watches in the market.
It works with Stripe to make the process easier and safer.

This is not an online store therefore, it will not process any order.
It's the final project from the code institute software development course.

If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.
