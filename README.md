## [FlyWatch](https://flywatch-jm.herokuapp.com/) 

Welcome to FlyWatch.

Come to our website to find the most exclusives watches in the market.
It works with Stripe to make the process easier and safer.

This is not an online store therefore, it will not process any order.
It's the final project from the code institute software development course.

If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.

* Products on the bottom of the page

#### Conclusion
The 2 background images look good in all devices.
The carousel image from the blog page looks also good.  
The carousel from the blog page will not display on small screen which looks good.
Carousel resizes the height depending of the content of the slide.
The products on the bottom of the page had their url wrong. I have fixed the code adding the right url to them so they could show on the homepage.

![Products Failing](images-readme/products-failing.png) 

### **Functionality**
Button 'Coming soon' on the home page works as it is expected to work taking the customer to the products page. 
Disabled carousel on the blog page for small screens. It looks better on big screens.  

The right/left carousel arrows work as it is expected to work. There are 2 pictures in this carousel.




### **User Experience**
#### User Story: The webstore has to be attractive so the customer can see themselves wearing the watches.
The big and close background image on the home pages gives the "fancy" feeling to the customer which can give high changes to a probable order.
When the user scroll down there is a second image that overflow the other image and gives the customer that feeling of surprise.


#### User Story: I want to have know some history about the products
There is a page on the webstore which is a small blog with a few products on it. It tells the story of specific products and it makes the customer feel a bit closer to the webstore.

#### Conclusion
The products that are displayed on the products page are very in terms of image quality. They are displayed with col-lg-4 when displayed in big screens and then the number of products shown on the page are reduced according to the size of the screen that they are displayed on.
The numbers and information are very clear and very proportional to the size of the screen.


### Functionality
In order to make the products being displayed very well distributed on the page, I have decided to use the row and col systems which makes the number of items on each page being calculated according to the size of the device screen.

The products are easy to be manipulated in terms of updating the number of watches that the customer want to go ahead placing the order.
If the customer wants to change the quantity of watches that they want to buy, the whole information about the order will change automatically being displayed on the page. It gives the customer more trust on the website.
The checkout form is also displayed well on the checkout page. The form is a crispy form which is easier to have the website being built on.
The bag app had a few templates created in order to make the display of the form better organised on different device screens.
The order details is also shown well on the page after the order is placed successfully.

#### Conclusion
The profile page is supposed to show the customer details after they added their own information to the website.
It also supposed to show the customer order history on the page which can remind the customer of a specific order and then the change of repeating that same order.
The confirmation email is coming out properly as picture below will show. I also added a flywatch name to the confirmation email just to give it better appearance 

### Functionality
The customer information is displayed on the website if the customer is already registered on the website.
If the customer is a new the form will be there to be filled out and then in the next time when the customer places an order, their details will be saved.
The order history is there also to let the customer know about their last orders.

![Form order](images-readme/form-order.png)

![Confirmation Email from Heroku](images-readme/confirmationEmailheroku.jpg)

![Confirmation Email from Gitpod](images-readme/confirmationGitpod.jpg)


## Navigation 
### Responsiveness
#### Where did I test?
I have tested the page with the home products on all types of devices such as Desktop, tablet and iphone.

#### What did I test?
* Display of nav links on large devices
* Display of hamburger icon and the links

#### Conclusion
The navigation looks very well organised on big screens. On small screens the navigation happend to look a little bit off because of the size of nav links on the nav.

![Nav off](images-readme/navbroken.png) 

The buttons look very organised and there is a good contrast between the buttons and the background page which makes the buttons very presentable.

### Functionality
The navbar works well on all devices screens. All the links in the navbar work taking the customer to the right places. 
The navbar collapses in a good way which makes the website very smooth.
The issue presented above happened because of the size of the nav links. I left these nav links with a smaller size and they got to fit well in the navbar.

![Nav working](images-readme/nav-working.png)

## Footer 
### Responsiveness
#### Where did I test?
I have tested the page with the home products on all types of devices such as Desktop, tablet and iphone.

#### What did I test?
* Responsiveness
* The links in the footer

#### Conclusion
The footer works pretty well in all devices. Its a simple footer with 4 links. All 4 links take to 4 different pages.

### Functionality
Beside the footer responsiveness working well on all screens, the links do their job also. The first home link takes the customer to the home page. The secodn link is a link that takes the customer straight to their mail app to email the webstore. The third link is a link to the products page and then the last link is link to the webstore FAQ.


## **Deployment**

### Local Deployment

The project was created using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
The project was created using command "git commit -m '' ".
And then the project was deployed using Heroku.

This project was also created an account on Stripe where the customer will be able to use in order to place the orders.


To clone the project: 

1. Go to the application's repository and then download the zip of the repository. 
    Or you can also clone the repository following the line below:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/JoseMachado-CE/Fly-Watch.git
    ``` 

2. Access the requirement folder through your terminal window and follow the line below:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. In your IDE environment variables or in env.py" if you want to have the variables below:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"

    os.environ["DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL"] = 'DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL'

    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    os.environ["STRIPE_CURRENCY"] = "EUR"

    ```
    

    If you plan to go ahead created env.py make sure to add it to > .gitignore file.

1. Migrate database using the line below:
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
1. Create a superuser using line below:
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
1. You can run the project using running the line below:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The address to access the website is displayed in the terminal  
    Add /admin to the end to access the admin panel with your superuser credentials

    
### Heroku Deployment 

1. Login to your heroku account and create your app. 
1. Once you have app created you can look for the heroku Postgress to attach a postgress DB to your project. 
    
1. Now you go to 'settings' and then click on the "Reveal config vars" button. Set up the same variables as in either your env.py or on gitpod settings variables.:
 

    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "AWS_S3_REGION_NAME"
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME"
    USE_AWS = True
    
    DATABASE_URL = "This variable is automatically set when adding the Postgres Add on"

    SECRET_KEY = "SECRET_KEY"

    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    STRIPE_CURRENCY = EUR

    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL"
    EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = "EMAIL_HOST_PASS"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = "EMAIL_HOST_USER"
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    ```

1. Then you go to your project app settigs file and comment out the default database and and the lines belo:
    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('Put your DATABASE_URL here'))
    }
    ```
1. Migrate again with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```


1. And then create a superuser for the postgres database in order to get access to Django admin.
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    --> Make sure to check the boxes "verify" and "primary" on django admin.

1. After this you can load the data into your newly created database by using the following command: 

    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata <name of file containing the data *>
    ``` 


1. After migrations are complete, change database configurations to:
```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
```
This set up will allow your site to use Postgres in deployment and sqlite3 in development.


1. Make sure you have your requirements.txt file and your Procfile. In case you don't, follow the below steps:
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application

    ```

1. Add your files and commit them to GITHUB by running the following commands:
    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push
    ```

1. Add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py file
1. Disable collect static so that Heroku doesn't try to collect static files when you deploy by typing the following command in the terminal
    ```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
    ```
1. Go back to HEROKU and click "Deploy" in the navigation. 
1. Scroll down to Deployment method and Select Github. 
1. Look for your repository and click connect. 
1. Under automatic deploys, click 'Enable automatic deploys'

1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes. 


1. Store your static files and media files on AWS. You can find more information about this on [Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).
    If you would like to follow a tutorial instead, visit [this tutorial on Youtube from Amazon Web Services](https://youtube.com/watch?v=e6w9LwZJFIA)

1. Set up email service to send confirmation email and user verification email to the users. You can do this by following the next steps (Gmail only)

(Be aware that this migth be different for other providers or the process might have changed over time)

* Go to your email account and go to your account settings
* Under Security, scroll down to Signing in to Google and make sure 2 step verification is turned on
* Under the same heading (Signing in to Google) you will see the 'App passwords' option.
* Click on the option, select mail for the app and under device type select other and fill in 'Django'
* You will now get a password which you should copy and set it as a config variable in Heroku:

```
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = 'Password you just copied'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'Your gmail account
```
* Go to your settings.py in casa_pedra_nobre directory and add the following:

```
    if "DEVELOPMENT" in os.environ:
        EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
        DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
    else:
        EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
        EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
        EMAIL_PORT = 587
        EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
        EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
        DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
```


## **Credits**

I wanted to start giving credits to Code Institute for giving me this opportunity to do this course and see how this course played a big role in my life. I wanted to thank all the people that work for Code Institute, all the tutors and the other staff that make the life of students a way better and smother.
